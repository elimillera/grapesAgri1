# Summary
<div align="justify">India has one of the world's largest agricultural education system. According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the main regulator of agricultural education in India, there are 63 State Agricultural Universities, 4 deemed universities and 3 Central Agricultural Universities. These institutions enrol on annual basis about 15,000 students at Under Graduate and over 7,000 students at Post Graduate and more than 2000 at PhD level. At any point, there are over 75,000 students studying in these institutions. Research activities are performed actively in all these universities.</div> 
  
<div align="justify">Agricultural experiments demand a wide range of statistical tools for analysis, which includes from Exploratory analysis, Design of experiments and Statistical genetics. Scientist and research students were in trouble to find a suitable platform for their data analysis in order to publish the research in quality journals. Though several online platforms were available for data analysis, they are not much updated up to the current publication standards at international level. Also, they donâ€™t provide opportunity to generate plots and graphs for publication.</div>
  
<div align="justify">R provides an excellent platform for data analysis. This powerful computation platform is not much utilised by researchers in agricultural field. What hinder R from getting utilised by agricultural researchers is the coding and computational knowledge required. Also, researchers in Agriculture prefer a graphical user interface.</div>
  
<div align="justify">Efforts should be made to develop a high quality reliable open-source platform with an interactive user interface for data analysis in agriculture. In this light utilising the features of shiny package in R, we have developed a collection of shiny apps for agricultural research ``grapesAgri1`` (General R-shiny based Analysis Platform Empowered by Statistics for data analysis in Agriculture-part1) It can be hosted on the web (www.kaugrapes.com), downloadable as a standalone application and we have realised it in to an R package.</div>
  
<div align="justify">On using the functions in ``grapesAgri1`` package a Graphical User Interface will pop up. Apps are self-explanatory and works by simple upload of files in CSV format. Results can be downloaded as docx, PDF or HTML format. Plots and Graphs can be generated, which are also downloadable as .png file.</div>
